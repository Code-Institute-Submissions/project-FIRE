# UX Design üéØ

### Information architecture

```
    
    1. The index page provides the user with 3 distinct choices. Every choice has an interesting writeup to let the 
       user make an informed decision and a bright orange button to navigate to the respective pages. The index page is
       also the only page with a video as its background because I did not wish to compromise on readability on the other
       text heavy pages.
       
    2. The navigation links allows the user to browse through each choice easily. The navigation links are also 
       available on every page.
    
    3. The About page has 5 very distinct orange same-page navigation buttons for users to navigate easily to their
       desired article. Each article section is also separated with distinctive boxes enveloping them.
       In the 2 main approaches article, there are 2 buttons designated for user to have ease of access to saver and grower page.
     
    4. The search bar and button on the grower and saver pages are big and obvious for users to extract the infomation they desire.
    
    5. The undecided page offers the user a direct and to the point survey to pin point the type of investment they are most
       suited for.
       
    6. The contact us page comprises of a big glaring Reddit icon and turns orange when hovered over. This is to show users clearly that
       the button is an external link to the community page.

```

### Mobile responsiveness

```

    1. Website is fully mobile responsive on all screen sizes.
    
    2. Navbar shrinks to a hamburger and creates a whole page length dropdown. This so so that the background text would not be in the way
       of the navigation.
    
```
